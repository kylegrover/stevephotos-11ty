so i'm at the laundromat yesterday and theres these three kids playing with a laundry cart. the littlest is in it and the biggest is pushing it occasionily crashing it into stuff while all three of em laugh. after i load i go and sit down. i read for a bit and i look up and the middle kid has opened an entire bank of empty front load doors (5) and the big kid gets a running start and smashes the cart with the little kid in it into the whole row knocking the doors shut as he goes. every time he hits a door i make a big exploding noise which im really good at. then theres this yelling and its the mom coming and before she chews out her kids she shoots me the dirtiest look i have gotten in at least twenty years. after that the kids sat in chairs and i hid behind my news paper.
