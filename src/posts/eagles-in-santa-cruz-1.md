so I'm walking home across the people bridge on the San Lorenzo river. and i see this guy i used to work with five or six years ago who retired when he was eighty. I go hey Virgil and he looks at me and goes "hey mon" but i don't know if he recognizes me. he tells me hes watching the eagles in the sky. i look up and see seagulls. i go those are seagulls. and he's like "no that dark one there its an eagle look how it soars."  I was gonna say no that's just a grey seagull but i think screw it if he wants to see eagles let him see eagles and i go "yeah that one looks like an eagle."
